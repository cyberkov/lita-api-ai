# lita-api-ai

This plugin uses the AI routine from http://api.ai to give your bot some personality

## Installation

Add lita-api-ai to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-api-ai"
```
you may need to add "api-ai-ruby" to your Gemfile as well if it complains about being unable to load it.

## Configuration

Add in the API key you generate at api.ai into your config.

config.handlers.api_ai.api_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

In case you want to have lita check the returned output against routes of other plugins, you can enable it with:

config.handlers.api_ai.match_routes = true

## Usage

Start your bot up and start talking.


Based heavily on Lita-ai (thanks Tom)
